Role Name
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bbatsche/Ansible-Common-Role.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bbatsche/Ansible-Role-Template)

A brief description of the role goes here.

Requirements
------------

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in regards to parameters that may need to be set for other roles, or variables that are used from other roles.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
     - { role: bbatsche.rolename, x: 42 }
```

Testing
-------

Included with this role is a set of specs for testing each task individually or as a whole. To run these tests you will first need to have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed. The spec files are written using [Serverspec](http://serverspec.org/) so you will need Ruby and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

To run the full suite of specs:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ rake
```

The spec suite will target both Ubuntu Trusty Tahr (14.04) and Xenial Xerus (16.04).

To see the available rake tasks (and specs):

```bash
$ rake -T
```

These specs are **not** meant to test for idempotence. They are meant to check that the specified tasks perform their expected steps. Idempotency is tested independently via integration testing.
